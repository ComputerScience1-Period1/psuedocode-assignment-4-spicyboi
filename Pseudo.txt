On how to play Go Fish
Rules
Go Fish works using a simple deck of 52 cards. Each player has a hand, usually of five or seven cards. Each player takes turns, each turn asking if another player has a card or cards with a certain face value. If not, the asking player has to take another card. If the other player has the requested card, they must give all cards of that face value to the other player. If you have all four cards of a certain value, you may lay them down in a stack, face-up, which is called a book. Once all card values have been turned into books, the player with the most books wins.

                        *When player y’s turn ends, set turn to next player.
  * On player x’s turn:
      * Player x asks “Player y, do you have any…”
      * Insert the value of a card after that //Example: An ace, 10s, 4s…      
  * If Player y lacks the requested card(s):
      * Player y says “Go Fish”
      * Player x has to draw a card from the deck   
      * End player x’s turn
  * Else:
      * Player y gives all requested card(s) to Player x
      * Player x may ask again //This means player x can ask over and over until you have to Go Fish!     
* On player y’s turn:
   * Player y asks “Player x, do you have any…”
      * Insert the value of a card after that
   * If Player y lacks the requested card(s):
      * Player x says “Go Fish”
      * Player y has to draw a card from the deck
      * End player y’s turn
   * If Player y has requested card(s):
      * Player x gives all requested card(s) to Player x
